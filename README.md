# ML_Algos
Collection of python implementations for classic Machine Learning Algorithms. I implemented these for a Machine Learning class in which I applied these to dataset in a kaggle competition for classifying movie review. A link to this competition can be seen here https://www.kaggle.com/c/uofu-ml-fall-2018. I placed 9th out of 122 students using the averaged perceptron algorithm.
